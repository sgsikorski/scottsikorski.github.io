            <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Rochester expected to graduate May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science.
                I am interested in the development and optimization of algorithms for backend purposes, mostly in software systems and machine learning. 
                This mainly includes machine learning for computer architecture and programming language design.
                I plan on attending graduate school to get my masters within the field of software systems or compiler design.
                Additionally, I work on creating algorithms that can be used to improve latency issues to optimize AI or simulate experments to improve productivity and reduce power usage.
                Most of these algorithms are directly related to the research that I am doing right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well, I run long distance on the UR cross country and track team where I try to use coding as a method to improve my running performance
                and reduce the risk of injury. These programs that I have built have helped me go to NCAA D3 Track and Field nationals in the 800M, 1500M, and mile.
                This past spring, I finished 3rd overall and ran 4:03 in the mile.

            <h2 id="research-main"><a href="/research">My current research</a></h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a part of a research group called TriForce under Dr. Adam B. Sefkow that reproduces Particle-In-Cell (PIC) experiments
                by creating algorithms to reduce computational and memory usage and noise. This summer I have created an algorithm called 
                Quiet Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (QDSMC) to be used for 3D hydrodynamics problems. An up-to-date presentation is available in 
                the research tab found above.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of November, I have worked on cross beam energy transfer (CBET) with optimizing, verifying, and documenting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming languages involved are Python, C++, CUDA (NVIDIA), and MATLAB.

            <h2 id="Garmin-intern">Software Engineering Internship at Garmin</h2>
            <p>
                Summer 2022 & Future Summer 2023 Intern at Garmin in Kansas City doing high-level and mid-level embedded systems software development.
                I am within the fitness watch segment working on the Forerunner series. Primary language of C++ used for development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the 2022 summer, I contributed towards a feature complete build to implement new features while fixing bugs.
                Balanced developing between current market products and internal products. As well, worked on submodules
                to create new APIs and call them accordingly to move logic to a more practical layer.

            <h2 id="project2-main"><a href="/projects">Complete optimized C compiler</a></h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of multiple school projects, I have put together a machine independent optimized C compiler. Combination of C++ and Python used.
            </p>
            <h2 id="project-main"><a href="/projects">Running Log</a></h2>
            <p>
                As a solo project, I am in process of creating a running log that gives body statistics and training advice with
                data that is scraped from the Garmin (TM) API. Primary language of Python
