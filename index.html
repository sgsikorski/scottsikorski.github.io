        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>
                Hey! I'm Scott Sikorski, a Masters student in computer science at the University of Virginia.
                I recently graduated from the University of Rochester in 2023 where I previously worked in 
                parallel computing with GPUs using CUDA and OpenMP and compiler optimizations with software analysis techniques.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While at UVA, I have been working on Task and Motion Planning for Mobile Home Robots. I have combined a variety of 
                reinforcement learning techniques to create a model that can learn complex sequential tasks in home environments.

                I have also worked on hardware accelerators, mainly GPUs, to speed up simulations. I've focused on improving
                throughput of CPU-GPU communication and optimizing memory access patterns to reduce latency. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have primarily done industry work in Embedded Software for consumer electronics.
                This includes wearable fitness devices to help people track their workouts and train more effectively
                in their respective sports. Being a big runner myself, I'm very passionate in creating tools that
                can help people reach their goals and dreams. "No Human is Limited" ~ Eluid Kipchoge (First human under 2:00, Former Marathon World Record Holder)

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            Outside of work, I am a Division 1 track athlete in the middle distance events at UVA.
            I was also a member of the UR track team.
            Check out my PRs on my <a href="https://worldathletics.org/athletes/united-states/scott-sikorski-14984137">World Athletics profile</a>.
            Or even follow along with my training at <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/sikorski_scott">Strava</a> and see what I'm up to this week!

            Outside of training, I enjoy spending time outdoors as we are near Shenandoah National Park.
            I enjoy most types of music and am always looking for new artists to listen to.
            Some albums that I've liked a lot recently include
            <ul>
                <li>Beloved! Paradise! Jazz? - McKinley Dixon</li>
                <li>Ants From Up There - Black Country, New Road</li>
                <li>Troupeau bleu - Cortex</li>
                <li>MM..FOOD - MF DOOM</li>
