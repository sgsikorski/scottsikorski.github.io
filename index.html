            <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
            <p>
                I have graduated from the University of Rocheter in May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science. While at UR, I was
                a research assistant for Dr. Adam Sefkow and an Advanced Compiler TA for Dr. Sreepathi Pai. I aided in optimizing
                physics simulations to increase resolution while decreasing memory and time constraints of the process.
                I took several classes to explore my specialized interests in CS. This included Advanced Compilers, a class I would
                go on to TA for, Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Programming Language Design, and theory classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now a candidate for a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I will be continuing my passion
                for computer system optimizations for parallel processing and GPU computation. Some coursework includes ML for Compiler design,
                Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Architecture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As well, I was a member of the cross country and track teams at UR and now at UVA. I use programming as a way to
                help me track my progress and training while aiding me in being the best athlete that I can be. I have automated
                daily tasks to make life easier while adding music capabilities to share music with my friends.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Garmin-intern">Software Engineering Internship at Garmin</h2>
            <p>
                Summer 2022 & Summer 2023 Intern at Garmin in Kansas City doing high-level and mid-level embedded systems software development.
                I am within the fitness watch segment working on the Forerunner series. Primary language of C++ used for development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the 2022 summer, I contributed towards a feature complete build to implement new features while fixing bugs.
                Balanced developing between current market products and internal products. As well, worked on submodules
                to create new APIs and call them accordingly to move logic to a more practical layer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In progress of the 2023 summer, development and maintenance of the C/C++ shared codebase. 
                I have built unit image tests for page transition animations and watch face data fields to confirm graphical changes.
                These tests check for cut off text and proper data transitions across all products when the UI is modified.
                In-house Jenkins servers will fail product builds if UI change fails requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, new activity profiles that are hooked up to submodules for functionality were added.
                QMR FQC's were also addressed on the side.
            </p>
            <h2 id="research-main"><a href="/research">My past research</a></h2>
            <p>
                I was a part of a research group called TriForce under Dr. Adam B. Sefkow that reproduces Particle-In-Cell (PIC) experiments
                by creating algorithms to reduce computational and memory usage and noise. This summer I have created an algorithm called 
                Quiet Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (QDSMC) to be used for 3D hydrodynamics problems. An up-to-date presentation is available in 
                the research tab found above.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also worked on cross beam energy transfer (CBET) with parallel and GPU optimizations, verifying, and documenting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming languages involved are Python, C++, CUDA (NVIDIA), and MATLAB.
            </p>
            <h2 id="project2-main"><a href="/projects">Complete optimized C compiler</a></h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of multiple school projects, I have put together a machine independent optimized C compiler. Combination of C++ and Python used.
            </p>
            <h2 id="project2-main"><a href="/projects">Autonomous Robot</a></h2>
            <p>
                School project of 7 degree of freedom robot to autonomously complete grasping and placing objects tasks.

            <h2 id="project-main"><a href="/projects">Running Log</a></h2>
            <p>
                As a solo project, I am in process of creating a running log that gives body statistics and training advice with
                data that is scraped from the Garmin (TM) API. Primary language of Python
