            <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Rochester expected to graduate May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science.
                I am interested in the development and optimization of algorithms for backend purposes, mostly in software systems. I plan on
                applying to graduate schools to get my MS within the field of software systems or compiler design.
                Additionally, I work on creating algorithms that can be used to improve latency issues to optimize AI or simulate experments to improve productivity and reduce power usage.
                Most of these algorithms are directly related to the research that I am doing right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well, I run long distance on the UR cross country and track team where I try to use coding as a method to improve my running performance
                and reduce the risk of injury. These programs that I have built have helped me go to NCAA D3 Track and Field nationals in the mile, where I run 4:08.
            </p>

            <h1 id="right-now">Right Now</h1>
            <h2 id="research-main"><a href="/research">My current research</a></h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a part of a research group called TriForce under Dr. Adam B. Sefkow that reproduces Particle-In-Cell (PIC) experiments
                by creating algorithms to reduce computational and memory usage and noise. This summer I have created an algorithm called 
                Quiet Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (QDSMC) to be used for 3D hydrodynamics problems.
            </p>
            <h2 id="project-main"><a href="/projects">Running Log</a></h2>
            <p>
                As a solo project, I am in process of creating a running log that gives body statistics and training advice with
                data that is scraped from the Garmin (TM) API. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="project2-main"><a href="/projects">Complete optimized C compiler</a></h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of multiple school projects, I have put together a machine independent optimized C compiler. Code is written in a combination of C++ and Python.
            </p>
