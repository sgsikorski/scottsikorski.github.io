            <h1>Machine independent optimized C compiler</h1>
            <p>
                For a subset of the C programming language, I built a compiler that scans, parses, builds intermediate representations, and optimizes the code.
                Scanner, parser, and abstract syntax tree (AST) are built using C++. 3 address code and all optimizations are implemented using Python3.
            </p>
            <div class="features">
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scanner that finds syntax errors</li>
                    <li>Parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) Error recovery is implented using Wirth's algorithm so that after an error, the program will
                        recover to find additional errors that are displayed to user.
                    </li>
                    <li>From AST, 3 address code is generated, which is machine independent, not control flow bound low level code</li>
                    <li>Using 3 address code, our basic blocks and control flow graph are generated to perform optimizations and thus data flow analysis</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Optimization methods used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Value Numbering</li>
                    <li>Dead Code elimination</li>
                    <li>Partial redunancy elimination</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h1>Autonomous 7 degree of freedom robot</h1>
            <p>
                Robot autonomously performs grasping and placing of objects in a world environment.
                World environment is built using sensors as state space is discretized over pi/16.0 radians.
                Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) are used to sample the state space and find shortest path.
                This is done by randomly sampling in robot link and joint limits then finding the nearest
                constructed node. A new node is added pi/16.0 radians in the direction of the sampled node
                and creates an edge between the nearest and new nodes. The back reference pointer to this
                node is then tracked to find the shortest path.

            <p>
                A variety of projects for my college house that improves the quality of life. Almost all these projects are run using Raspberry Pi's
                <div class = "features">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sound request station

                                Multi-user jukebox site that can be accessed through people's phones that are authorized. Authorization
                                is done through connection to home wifi network. Touchscreen tablet is also used to create a real jukebox.
                                Spotify API is then accessed to add songs to queue after passing through my filter.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Card swipe access to house locks
                            <ul>
                                <li>Using our URID cards, we can swipe, using an electromagnetic card reader, into the house, unlocking or locking the door</li>
                                <li>A servo is used to control the rods that rotate the deadlock.</li>
                                <li>Mechanical locking is supported as the program can recognize if the state of the lock is different from last usage.</li>
