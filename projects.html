            <h1>Machine independent optimized C compiler</h1>
            <p>
                For a subset of the C programming language, I built a compiler that scans, parses, builds intermediate representations, and optimizes the code.
                Scanner, parser, and abstract syntax tree (AST) are built using C++. 3 address code and all optimizations are implemented using Python3.
            </p>
            <div class="features">
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scanner that finds syntax errors</li>
                    <li>Parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) Error recovery is implented using Wirth's algorithm so that after an error, the program will
                        recover to find additional errors that are displayed to user.
                    </li>
                    <li>From AST, 3 address code is generated, which is machine independent, not control flow bound low level code</li>
                    <li>Using 3 address code, our basic blocks and control flow graph are generated to perform optimizations and thus data flow analysis</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Optimization methods used</h2>
                <ul>

            <h1>Autonomous 7 degree of freedom robot</h1>
            <p>
                Robot autonomously performs grasping and placing of objects in a world environment.
                World environment is built using sensors as state space is discretized over pi/16.0 radians.
                Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) are used to sample the state space and find shortest path.
                This is done by randomly sampling in robot link and joint limits then finding the nearest
                constructed node. A new node is added pi/16.0 radians in the direction of the sampled node
                and creates an edge between the nearest and new nodes. The back reference pointer to this
                node is then tracked to find the shortest path.
            </p>
            <p>
                A short demonstration of the routing of the grasp (blue) and place (red) is shown below.

            <h1>File compression</h1>
            <p>
                Class project in Java where given a file of any extension to reduce its memory storage.
                Huffman encoding algorithm is used to reduce the storage of upwards of 100% and usually 50%.
                Project also enables the user to decompress the file and see its original version.

            <p>
                I decided to build a running log during the pandemic as a way to stay sane and reduce my likelihood of overtraining.
                It is written in Python3 where users can add runs with distances, times, time of day, date, and comments. This data is 
                stored in a .csv file which is sorted in order by date whenever users add new runs. Because we have an already sorted 
                file, insertion sort is use after a user adds a run.
