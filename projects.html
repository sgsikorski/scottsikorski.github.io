            <h1>Reinforcement Learning for Task and Motion Planning in Mobile Home Robots</h1>
            <p>I utilized a Double Deep Q-Network learning approach to complete complex sequential tasks in home environments.
                The model was trained in unique environments on a variety of tasks that include motion and interactable tasks.
                Custom state one-hot encoding was used to represent the robot's state space in relation to the environment to 
                accommodate a real-time learning environment. Testing was conducted in the simulated environments to demonstrate
                the model's ability to learn the optimal policy for minimal actions and no failures.

            <h1>Lifelong Learning for Task and Motion Planning in Mobile Home Robots</h1>
            <p>Dual policy task and motion planning approach to catastrophic forgetting, the forgetting of task completion
                when placed in a new environment. One policy would guide the motion using a RRT. The other policy is trained
                using a limited memory replay buffer to simulate the memory constraints of a robot. This policy would ensure
                that the loss of previous tasks did not increase when learning new tasks using Gradient Episodic Memory. 
                This model suffered from poor exploration, which was addressed in the reinforcement learning version of this.

            <h1>Machine independent optimized C compiler</h1>
            <p>
                For a subset of the C programming language, I built a compiler that scans, parses, builds intermediate representations, and optimizes the code.
                Scanner, parser, and abstract syntax tree (AST) are built using C++. 3 address code and all optimizations are implemented using Python3.
            </p>
            <div class="features">
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scanner that finds syntax errors</li>
                    <li>Parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) Error recovery is implented using Wirth's algorithm so that after an error, the program will
                        recover to find additional errors that are displayed to user.
                    </li>
                    <li>From AST, 3 address code is generated, which is machine independent, not control flow bound low level code</li>
                    <li>Using 3 address code, our basic blocks and control flow graph are generated to perform optimizations and thus data flow analysis</li>
                    <li>Optimizations: Local Value Numbering, Dead Code elimination, Partial redunancy elimination</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Autonomous 7 degree of freedom robot</h1>
            <p>
                Robot autonomously performs grasping and placing of objects in a world environment.
                World environment is built using sensors as state space is discretized over pi/16.0 radians.
                Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) are used to sample the state space and find shortest path.
                This is done by randomly sampling in robot link and joint limits then finding the nearest
                constructed node. A new node is added pi/16.0 radians in the direction of the sampled node
                and creates an edge between the nearest and new nodes. The back reference pointer to this
                node is then tracked to find the shortest path.
